# Anki_cards_for_ACSAI_people

Hi dudes,

I tried to share with you my flashcards earlier, or reddit, and on out group,
now I decide to use gitbub, to ease updating when new cards will be added.

First of all, maybe some of us are not fmiliar with the idea of spaced repetition and flashcards,

Why would somebody use flashcards?

Well, the goal is to keep information remembered with as little time spent and effort.
The human memory works in this way: information once remembered, decreases its strength in an exponential way: just like

the boiling water cools down and gets closer and closer to the ambiece temperature,

or like radioactive decay, the ratio of forgotten knowledge is constant for any moment in time, for any fixed period of time.

Using the analogy with water, the spaced repetition algorithm predicts when information will reach a given "temperature", and then,

the moment of recall is scheduled, after a succesful recall (correct answer on a question), the "water" is boiled again, but after that,

it is kept in an insolated continer (the ambience temperature remains the same),

so, the algorithm predicts the time of recall in a more distant future than before,

after another positive recall the water is reboiled and put in - let us say - vacuum flask.

The better the isolation is, the more stable the memory is.

This is, in a nutshell, main idea of spaced repetition algorithm.
